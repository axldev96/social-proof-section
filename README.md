## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I really made progress on this project using media queries to make the website responsive, this challenge looks easy but controlling the code is hard for me with css, I really feel good about the result.

### Continued development

I would like to continue my progress on CSS with media queries and responsive layout with grid and flexbox.
